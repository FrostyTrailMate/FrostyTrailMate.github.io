Steps for detecting snow in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using machine learning: 

############# MY SEARCH ###############
I want to create a machine learning algorithm for an unsupervised learning problem, where I'm aiming to detect the presence of snow in SAR images, with backsatter intensity above 0.8, without having explicit labels indicating whether snow is present or not.

Assuming the SAR images are obtained from the sRaster field of the sar_raw table from a PostgreSQL database.

This algorithm should do everything automatically.

Assuming the workflow:
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature extraction, using backsatter intensity 
4. Labeling
5. Splitting the dataset
6. Selecting a machine learning model
7. Training the model
8. Evaluating it
9. Tuning and optimizing it
10. Deploying it


Give me the full python code for this.

# Step 1: Data Collection (Assuming PostgreSQL Database)

    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    host="your_host",

        mean_intensity = np.mean(sar_image)

# We're assuming intensity above 0.8 indicates snow presence

# Step 5: Splitting the Dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# For unsupervised learning, we'll use KMeans clustering
model = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)

# Step 7: Training the Model
model.fit(X_train.reshape(-1, 1))

# Step 8: Evaluating the Model
y_pred_train = model.predict(X_train.reshape(-1, 1))
